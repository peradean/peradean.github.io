<c2>Day 6 : Jan 14</c2>
    <br>
<a href=https://photos.app.goo.gl/7izAvZ5v2ekM5QoJA>Photos</a> of my second long walk through Austin.
    <br>
    I woke up and started watching a speedrun. Feeling completely relaxed and care-free, it became apparent how there are levels of reality: God's kingdom, nature, city life, toys, and fantasy worlds (such as games and movies). I haven't put much thought into this idea, so those category labels are probably not that great. Don't you notice a difference in how you feel about life when you're talking about heaven and miracles, or simply praying with someone, compared to how you feel when you're talking about StarWars? Or, taking a hike seeing the beauty of nature compared to walking around DisneyLand? Well, for me, one feels closer to the way life is supposed to be. Almost like truth is an emotion you can feel, a sense of what is really real. I guess that's the same as knowing what is more or less valuable and important.
     <br>
    And then there are a bunch of other emotions that yell at my mind, or whisper, as I walk in the city of Austin. I walked about a total of eight hours today plus yesterday. The only transportation I took, was a bus this afternoon from downtown Austin into the countryside, where Milo picked me up and then we stopped by WalMart for some groceries. The reason I took a pic of milk and eggs, is so that you can compare the Texas price with what you pay. Just in case you are curious. 
    <br>
    You probably want me to answer these questions: What did you think of Austin? Are you going to live there? What are the people like?
    <br>
    I couldn't quite pin point my nostalgia. Sometimes the plants reminded me of Okinawa, sometimes the neighborhoods felt like Australia, but most of the time I kept thinking of Seattle. I've only been in Seattle a few days (in 2017), but I did a lot of walking there too. I think it was the hipster style of fashion that made that connection. Austin's downtown felt pretty small and most of what I saw everywhere else was gated communities. Apartments everywhere. And the parks, though wide, seemed lacking in trails, playgrounds, or exercise equipment. Of course, having not talked to the locals, and spending less than 36 hours in the city, my judgment isn't going to be that fair. 
    <br>
    No, I don't plan on living there. I'd like to return to the Inland Empire, since that's where my family and friends live. By the way, I have a phone interview with the Montessori in Redlands this week. Let's pray for God's favor in that.

<c1>Day 5 : Jan 13</c1>
    <br>
I walked through the city of Austin, I was surprised how many streets felt ghost-townish.

<c2>Day 4 : Jan 12</c2>
    <br>
 Had my first Texas BBQ. Although, I don't know if it is technically BBQ, since it was cooked indoors in a kitched. But it did have BBQ sauce. It didn't taste any different from sloppy-joe type sandwitches that I've had in CA. The cowslaw though, was much better than any I've had. Less saucey and more, umm, cabbagey.  
    <br>
    As you'll see from today's pictures <a href=https://photos.app.goo.gl/GNgf4cXhFdyZVN9h8>(here)</a> after the round of morning feeding I took a ride. Walking through the maintenance barn, I stopped Milo, "Does this bike work?"
    <br>
    "Yeah, needs a little air, but should be just fine," squeezing the tires "you wanna ride it?"
    <br>
    "Yes, I'd like to."
    <br>
    "Sure, bring it on ova' here and we'll get ya fixed up. Just don't get a flat like all them other WWOOFers do. Heck, I tell them to watch out for crazy drivers and they come back with flats. They must be riding off the road. You break it, you fix it."
    <br>
    I rode east, down the part of the road I'd never seen yet. Huge properties with nice quiet yards, some with beautiful lawns. Absolutely perfect weather for a ride. My first offical exploring in Texas. I wasn't gone more than 30min. Upon returning the bike (with no flat), Milo informed me that every property in this area is 80 acres. 
<br>
    After dropping off our trailer for a refill on organic vegies, we stopped for BBQ, and there were three things I thought odd about the restaurant: 1. the tables were pushed together like a church picnic, 2. the kitchen wall was made by stacking their inventory items on shelves out in the open (so they had a sharpie sign saying, "Don't Take These Items") 3. next to the soda refill station and pickle self-serve fridge, there was a box full of ziplock bagged sliced sandwhich bread. Customers would take it as if it were another condiment.
    <br>
    Milo drove us home on a different route, and after showing me a river, he spotted a friend BBQing next to a small gas station. Turns out this guy was waiting for someone to hire him for a day job. He said he could direct Milo to a nearby house who might have a car part Milo needs. We passed some wide pasture lands and America's 5th largest solar energy field (accoring to Milo). But the retired mechanic didn't have what Milo was hoping for. He did have an extra puppy though, chained to an old rusted truck. The mechanic told this workless friend to take the dog, so he did.
    <br>
    When I finished unloading Germaine's van of farmer's market supplies, she had just started a discussion with Karen about how her farm is more than adaqute to survive a zombie apocalypse. And one of her comforts in such a crisis, is the fact that humans are by nature willing to serve a neighbor in need in such times of distress. I thought of some potential flaws in that theory, but I just said, "That's quite a creative story."
    <br>
    At dinner, Germaine suddenly threw out that I needed to work less. The guys said, "Just don't work more than us" followed by chuckles. But she was serious, "No really, there are some WWOOF rules that we don't want to break, so, just take longer breaks or end the day earlier." Then I asked, "So, do I understand correctly that my main job is feeding all the animals while you're out of town?" The guys laughed harder this time. I'm not sure why it was funny, other than they never mentioned exactly what I'm supposed to do each day while they're visiting a very old relative from Jan 21st to 25th. This sparked a conversation between them about how they would get the cows fed during that time, since it requires driving their small tractor. Maybe I should have told them that I could drive it.
    <br>
   Good news about this Austin trip (starting in 10 hours from now). Ivan will drive me all the way into downtown, since he's going there early tomorrow morning for another farmer's market. I'll sleep at a hostel or AirBnB. Then Monday evening I ride a bus to the tiny town of Manor outside Austin, where Milo picks me up. Besides walking and following the Lord, I don't really have anything planned for the two days.

<c1>Day 3 : Jan 11</c1>
    <br>
    I woke up to an explosion. In my dream. It was an Inception-like dream, not the lucidity part, but the intense action. Some lady was trying to find the secret papers to unlock unkimited power, so my brother and I flew around a fancy hotel to hide these papers in a unexpected location. I was laying under a bed when I knew the lady was following me. Then there are an explosion, and I woke up thinking, "Why was there a blast? That doesn't make any since."
    <br>
    Today was more enjoyable than yesterday. I tried to pray or praise, but so often my mind easily drifts to and fro. Most of the day I spent cleaning braches off bamboo shafts (seen <a href=>here</a>). 
     <br>
    I like opening the heavy metal driveway gate to let in Ivan or Milo in their trucks as they bring in different equipment or feed bags. "Where ya been all day?" Milo asks jumping out of his truck, walking to the trailer to unload a couple ton of gravel. "I was cleaning bamboo poles."
     <br>
    "You gunna build yer'self a stick house with that?" He laughs.
     <br>
    As the sun sets behind a dark overcast sky, I continue to stick with Milo, giving a hand by opening and closing more gates as he gets hay for pigs to sleep on. "The pigs need somthin soft ter lay on when this here rain gets going. And ol' JaJa over there is about to have some babies, so she needs a place to get warm with her lil ones."
     <br>
    Before I arrived on this farm, I was afraid the animal dung might really bother me, but thankfully it's not bad. In fact, it's actually kinda... nevermind. I'm also very glad I haven't got hay-fever. When I first met Milo, seeing him as a pontenial rough cowboy, I was very curious to see how he treated the farm animals. Needless to say, he really loves them. Yesterday's note about giving the pigs belly rubs was a reference to exactly what Milo does every time he walks in a muddy pen to feed some.
     <br>
    An hour after lunch, while I continued to cut bamboo, I heard a very frightened pig. I couldn't see it, but I saw some men with a truck in the driveway and realized they must have bought a little buddy. Later this was confirmed when Ivan said, "Did you notice the missing hog from the pen next to the chicken coup?"
     <br>
    "Yeah. His brother got sold huh?"
     <br>
    "Mm-hmm. I was hoping Milo would move the lone guy so he doesn't get too sad by himself. I think he'll prolly do it tomorrow. Now I gotta get some freezer meat ready for tomorrow's farmer's market."
     <br>
    I was hoping I might get to go into town with them tomorrow, but Milo and I will stay here and do the feeding routine. I'm really looking forward to exploring Austin, or even simply seeing more people. Which is what I'm planning to do on my days off: Sunday and Monday. My weekend might go something like: Sunday morning get an 8 mile ride from Germaine to McDonald's, access wifi and get an Uber ride 20 miles into Austin. Explore on foot, bus, or an Uber scooter. Sleep at an AirBnB for about $20. Explore more on Monday and ride a bus out of the city, and get a ride from one of my bosses back to Munkebo Farm.

<c2>Day 2 : Jan 10</c2>
    <br>
Only 24 hours on this ranch and already I'm contemplating, "Why am I doing this? Who would want to do this kind of work everyday? All I'm doing is feeding pigs and shoveling wood-chips into a wheel-barrel. On the other hand, even if the animals don't appreciate my work, surely the person (that one guy sitting alone watching TV in Reno) who eats this bacon next month will be thankful. And if I don't do this ministry of personally delivering organic butternut squash to each pig's trough and giving them rib massages, then the only meat available at WholeFoods would be from tortured slaughter factories."
    <br>
    My spoiled SoCal luxary life must be starting to detox already. I don't wanna wake at 6, I don't wanna skip my 2nd breakfast, I don't wanna skip my afternoon nap, I don't wanna spend the evening in a boring frosty cabin. Well, I found a solution to the last one: type this blog under my thick bed blankets while listening to music.
    <br>
        Milo continues to dream of the day when this ranch is converted into a small vegetable garden so that he can kick back with a beer and watch the weeds grow, and then the only work he has to do, is pull them. Which is totally understandable for a man who's done demanding physical labor for 60 years. But this mentality among these aging ranchers certainly doesn't inspire me to pursue this career. My mind wanders to other lucrative careers that don't require a sore back, as I collect wood for cutting.
<br>
    At the same time, I don't want to be primarily motivated by money. Though, it's been hard not to when starting a family is a big dream. I am thankful for the mini revelation God gave me as my plane made its decent into Austin. Seeing such micro cars slowly snake around curves and white crumb-sized buildings poke out between forests, I realized: why does money matter? I'm about to become one of those super tiny (and very slow) land creatures as soon as this plane touches the ground, and no one in China will be thinking about me. No one in Texas will be thinking about me, besides the other extremely small humans who might glance at me as they crawl a short distance, probably just to nibble on some cheese. No one in Europe. No one in Africa. Two people in America, maybe... in other words, the world is huge and my life is tiny. My glory is smaller, and my needs to live are just as little as I am. So why do I need thousands and thousands of American dollars? For a stove and a bag of wheat flour? For a private spa and Deluxe Hummer? God, being inventor and creator of my whole life (and everything), is the only treasure worth my time. No matter how small or big I feel, no matter how much or little I own.
<br> 
    Take Karen for example, she survived well enough in a primitive log cabin for two years in the cold mountains, with two babies. She told me that today. Now she has five children, but was her life less valuable as a poor mountain woman? 
<br>
    I'm not giving up on my farm dreams yet. Like I said, I still need to detox from city life and embrace the quiet country for what is it.

<c1>Day 1 : Jan 9</c1>
      <br>
"Oh, let's see, we've surely had more than 100 volunteers at our farm over the past eight years," Germaine tells me in her southern accent, as she drives me out of Austin past wide pastures to her ranch. Upon arriving she gives me a quick tour of the few buildings clustered on the south side of the property.
      <br>"My father was an art collector," leading into a long story of her recent family trials and triumphs. "Are those from your father too?" pointing at African artifacts in her living room. "No, my mother was an artist as well."
      <br>
      "Let's see if Milo is on the tractor, maybe he can show you the farm." Walking past piles of scrap metal, I've spotted more deserted vehicles than cows. "Milo and Ivan love cars, but we're trying to downsize so we can travel."
      <br>
      "Milo, this is Dean," as we shake hands,"this is his first time WWOOFing, so go easy on him."
      <br>
      "Sure, he'll be fine. He can ride in the truck when I take the trailer." I opened the two long gates on the driveway leading to the road. I was back on the same road, this time in a large manual diesel Dodge truck, towing a huge trailer which will be filled with organic vegetables from a local factory, to used as pig feed.
      <br>Milo's right ear is deaf, so I loudy ask, "Don't you get tired of training so many volunteers?"
      <br>
     His drawl and scratchy voice make me focus my ears,"Nah, I don't mind. It's fun. If I can teach one important thing to these youngsters, than it's worth it. You never know what will be useful later." He smiles, putting the truck in reverse, backing into the factory parking bay, "My father was a great teacher."
      <br>On the way home, after getting two massive bales of hay (for cow feed), I ask, "how many cows are on the farm?"
      <br>"Hmm, well we had about 30, but we're at 24 now, 22? And three horses, two donkeys, 50 ducks, and 30 some pigs. If we have time today, I'll show you my friend Leo, he's a gigantic guy, easily 300 pounds."
      <br> After putting some blankets inside the trailer which I'll sleep in, I walk across the muddy yard in my new boots into the house for dinner. Germaine is still fixing the salad, so I talk to her friend Karan at the table about her daughter in South Korea. She asks if I can recommend a store where she might be able to find American foods. After thinking a minute, I remember Costco is in Seoul. 
      <br> When the non-spicy meat curry is served, Ivan (Germaine's husband) says, "you can say a blessing, if you normally do that." 
      <br>"I'll do it in my heart."
      <br>"I do that too," he replies.
      <br>Milo and I wash the dishes, and he explains how Corelle plates are hard to break, but when they do shatter, he says it's quite amazing how many tiny pieces of glass you'll find in the oddest places.
     <br>My bedroom is on the other side of a shed, which means I'll need to walk outside around that barrier to upload this blog.
