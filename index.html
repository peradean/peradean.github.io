<co>Day 1 : Jan 9</co>

"Oh, let's see, we've surely had more than 100 volunteers at our farm over the past eight years," Germaine tells me in her southern accent, as she drives me out of Austin past wide pastures to her ranch. Upon arriving she gives me a quick tour of the few buildings clustered on the south side of the property.
      <br>"My father was an art collector," leading into a long story of her recent family trials and triumphs. "Are those from your father too?" pointing at African artifacts in her living room. "No, my mother was an artist as well."
      <br>
      "Let's see if Milo is on the tractor, maybe he can show you the farm." Walking past piles of scrap metal, I've spotted more deserted vehicles than cows. "Milo and Ivan love cars, but we're trying to downsize so we can travel."
      <br>
      "Milo, this is Dean," as we shake hands,"this is his first time WWOOFing, so go easy on him."
      <br>
      "Sure, he'll be fine. He can ride in the truck when I take the trailer." I opened the two long gates on the driveway leading to the road. I was back on the same road, this time in a large manual diesel Dodge truck, towing a huge trailer which will be filled with organic vegetables from a local factory, to used as pig feed.
      <br>Milo's right ear is deaf, so I loudy ask, "Don't you get tired of training so many volunteers?"
      <br>
     His drawl and scratchy voice make me focus my ears,"Nah, I don't mind. It's fun. If I can teach one important thing to these youngsters, than it's worth it. You never know what will be useful later." He smiles, putting the truck in reverse, backing into the factory parking bay, "My father was a great teacher."
      <br>On the way home, after getting two massive bales of hay (for cow feed), I ask, "how many cows are on the farm?"
      <br>"Hmm, well we had about 30, but we're at 24 now, 22? And three horses, two donkeys, 50 ducks, and 30 some pigs. If we have time today, I'll show you my friend Leo, he's a gigantic guy, easily 300 pounds."
      <br> After putting some blankets inside the trailer which I'll sleep in, I walk across the muddy yard in my new boots into the house for dinner. Germaine is still fixing the salad, so I talk to her friend Karan at the table about her daughter in South Korea. She asks if I can recommend a store where she might be able to find American foods. After thinking a minute, I remember Costco is in Seoul. 
      <br> When the non-spicy meat curry is served, Ivan (Germaine's husband) says, "you can say a blessing, if you normally do that." 
      <br>"I'll do it in my heart."
      <br>"I do that too," he replies.
      <br>Milo and I wash the dishes, and he explains how Corelle plates are hard to break, but when they do shatter, he says it's quite amazing how many tiny pieces of glass you'll find in the oddest places.
     <br>My bedroom is on the other side of a shed, which means I'll need to walk outside around that barrier to upload this blog.
