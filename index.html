<c2>Day 2 : Jan 10</c2>
    <br>
Only 24 hours on this ranch and already I'm contemplating, "Why am I doing this? Who would want to do this kind of work everyday? All I'm doing is feeding pigs and shoveling wood-chips into a wheel-barrel. On the other hand, even if the animals don't appreciate my work, surely the person (that one guy sitting alone watching TV in Reno) who eats this bacon next month will be thankful. And if I don't do this ministry of personally delivering organic butternut squash to each pig's trough and giving them rib massages, then the only meat available at WholeFoods would be from tortured slaughter factories."
    <br>
    My spoiled SoCal luxary life must be starting to detox already. I don't wanna wake at 6, I don't wanna skip my 2nd breakfast, I don't wanna skip my afternoon nap, I don't wanna spend the evening in a boring frosty cabin. Well, I found a solution to the last one: type this blog under my thick bed blankets while listening to music.
    <br>
        Milo continues to dream of the day when this ranch is converted into a small vegetable garden so that he can kick back with a beer and watch the weeds grow, and then the only work he has to do, is pull them. Which is totally understandable for a man who's done demanding physical labor for 60 years. But this mentality among these aging ranchers certainly doesn't inspire me to pursue this career. My mind wanders to other lucrative careers that don't require a sore back, as I collect wood for cutting.
<br>
    At the same time, I don't want to be primarily motivated by money. Though, it's been hard not to when starting a family is a big dream. I am thankful for the mini revelation God gave me as my plane made its decent into Austin. Seeing such micro cars slowly snake around curves and white crumb-sized buildings poke out between forests, I realized: why does money matter? I'm about to become one of those super tiny (and very slow) land creatures as soon as this plane touches the ground, and no one in China will be thinking about me. No one in Texas will be thinking about me, besides the other extremely small humans who might glance at me as they crawl a short distance, probably just to nibble on some cheese. No one in Europe. No one in Africa. Two people in America, maybe... in other words, the world is huge and my life is tiny. My glory is smaller, and my needs to live are just as little as I am. So why do I need thousands and thousands of American dollars? For a stove and a bag of wheat flour? For a private spa and Deluxe Hummer? God, being inventor and creator of my whole life (and everything), is the only treasure worth my time. No matter how small or big I feel, no matter how much or little I own.
<br> 
    Take Karen for example, she survived well enough in a primitive log cabin for two years in the cold mountains, with two babies. She told me that today. Now she has five children, but was her life less valuable as a poor mountain woman? 
<br>
    I'm not giving up on my farm dreams yet. Like I said, I still need to detox from city life and embrace the quiet country for what is it.

<c1>Day 1 : Jan 9</c1>
      <br>
"Oh, let's see, we've surely had more than 100 volunteers at our farm over the past eight years," Germaine tells me in her southern accent, as she drives me out of Austin past wide pastures to her ranch. Upon arriving she gives me a quick tour of the few buildings clustered on the south side of the property.
      <br>"My father was an art collector," leading into a long story of her recent family trials and triumphs. "Are those from your father too?" pointing at African artifacts in her living room. "No, my mother was an artist as well."
      <br>
      "Let's see if Milo is on the tractor, maybe he can show you the farm." Walking past piles of scrap metal, I've spotted more deserted vehicles than cows. "Milo and Ivan love cars, but we're trying to downsize so we can travel."
      <br>
      "Milo, this is Dean," as we shake hands,"this is his first time WWOOFing, so go easy on him."
      <br>
      "Sure, he'll be fine. He can ride in the truck when I take the trailer." I opened the two long gates on the driveway leading to the road. I was back on the same road, this time in a large manual diesel Dodge truck, towing a huge trailer which will be filled with organic vegetables from a local factory, to used as pig feed.
      <br>Milo's right ear is deaf, so I loudy ask, "Don't you get tired of training so many volunteers?"
      <br>
     His drawl and scratchy voice make me focus my ears,"Nah, I don't mind. It's fun. If I can teach one important thing to these youngsters, than it's worth it. You never know what will be useful later." He smiles, putting the truck in reverse, backing into the factory parking bay, "My father was a great teacher."
      <br>On the way home, after getting two massive bales of hay (for cow feed), I ask, "how many cows are on the farm?"
      <br>"Hmm, well we had about 30, but we're at 24 now, 22? And three horses, two donkeys, 50 ducks, and 30 some pigs. If we have time today, I'll show you my friend Leo, he's a gigantic guy, easily 300 pounds."
      <br> After putting some blankets inside the trailer which I'll sleep in, I walk across the muddy yard in my new boots into the house for dinner. Germaine is still fixing the salad, so I talk to her friend Karan at the table about her daughter in South Korea. She asks if I can recommend a store where she might be able to find American foods. After thinking a minute, I remember Costco is in Seoul. 
      <br> When the non-spicy meat curry is served, Ivan (Germaine's husband) says, "you can say a blessing, if you normally do that." 
      <br>"I'll do it in my heart."
      <br>"I do that too," he replies.
      <br>Milo and I wash the dishes, and he explains how Corelle plates are hard to break, but when they do shatter, he says it's quite amazing how many tiny pieces of glass you'll find in the oddest places.
     <br>My bedroom is on the other side of a shed, which means I'll need to walk outside around that barrier to upload this blog.
