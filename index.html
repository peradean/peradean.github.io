I think this new omnivore diet is making me very sleepy. If this persists, then I won't eat meat. Walking into class at 7:58am today, a student asked, "Dean, are you tired?", <br>
"Yeah."
<br>
"You look exhausted."
<br><br>
Today marks the end of my Health class and Public Speaking class. Both were very easy. Now with more time during the next five weeks, I'll need to think of something productive to do. Some ideas at the moment are: eat more, exercise more, read more, study Montessori curriculum.

2 years ago I left Korea to return to Yucaipa.
<br>
21 months ago I stopped eating meat, but today that ended. I asked Jeff to cook salmon for me.
<br>
Why did I end my vegan diet?
<br>
1) My muscles spasm a little when I workout (been happening for a year). I'm sure i could fix this with nutrition in some certain plants or suppliments, but I want to see if meat helps.
<br>
2) Jesus said not to worry about what I'm going to eat, but I think I've been doing that too much as a vegan.
<br>
3) My last GF, Khulan, stopped talking to me. I don't know why, but I do know she really wanted me to eat meat. I don't want my diet to complicate a future relationship.
<br>
4) I've been 120lbs since high school, but two days ago I was 116, which was alarming. I know it is possible to gain weight with plants, but I hope it is easier with meat.
<br><br>
The last few months I was considering moving to Texas. I almost had myself convinced that the grass was greener. But after talking to Pastor Max, it makes sense to continue nurturing the good relations I've begun. Namely, my family and Emmaus.
