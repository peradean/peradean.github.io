Roy was sitting on floor, next to his car, in the parking lot. 93Â° outside. I thought I was strong enough to help him into the passenger seat, but I was wrong. So I ran back into the store looking for a clerk, but no one in sight. I looked back at the parking lot and saw a middle aged (strong enough) man get out of his Mustang. 
  <br>
  "Excuse me, can you please help me? I'm trying to get my grandpa into to the car but he is too heavy for me, can you please help?"
  <br>
  "OK."
  <br>
  After five minutes of struggle, we got Roy in.
  <br>
  Then Moshin began to tell his story, "You are such kind man. My father was like that. He passed away this year," <i>pushing away tears</i> "many people will not help there family like this. In my home country, maybe. But this is very special to see in America. God will bless you. You are great man. Really, I know,"
  <br>
  "Dean! Can you turn on the AC now!"
  <br>
  "Oh! He's calling me, just a moment."
  <br>
  And here I thought this guy would be angry for not getting paid to work up such a sweat in this firey weather. His story made me think I should be quick to move to Lompoc when my dad needs help.
  <br> This also made me think a little of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Franklin_effect">Benjamin Franklin effect</a>.

I think this new omnivore diet is making me very sleepy. If this persists, then I won't eat meat. Walking into class at 7:58am today, a student asked, "Dean, are you tired?", <br>
"Yeah."
<br>
"You look exhausted."
<br><br>
Today marks the end of my Health class and Public Speaking class. Both were very easy. Now with more time during the next five weeks, I'll need to think of something productive to do. Some ideas at the moment are: eat more, exercise more, read more, study Montessori curriculum.

2 years ago I left Korea to return to Yucaipa.
<br>
21 months ago I stopped eating meat, but today that ended. I asked Jeff to cook salmon for me.
<br>
Why did I end my vegan diet?
<br>
1) My muscles spasm a little when I workout (been happening for a year). I'm sure i could fix this with nutrition in some certain plants or suppliments, but I want to see if meat helps.
<br>
2) Jesus said not to worry about what I'm going to eat, but I think I've been doing that too much as a vegan.
<br>
3) My last GF, Khulan, stopped talking to me. I don't know why, but I do know she really wanted me to eat meat. I don't want my diet to complicate a future relationship.
<br>
4) I've been 120lbs since high school, but two days ago I was 116, which was alarming. I know it is possible to gain weight with plants, but I hope it is easier with meat.
<br><br>
The last few months I was considering moving to Texas. I almost had myself convinced that the grass was greener. But after talking to Pastor Max, it makes sense to continue nurturing the good relations I've begun. Namely, my family and Emmaus.
