<c2>Day 16 : Jan 24</c2>  <c3>: The End</c3>
        <br>
This is the final blog post. After today I won't be adding anything to this blog. 
    <br>
  After lunch I sat near the horses and donkeys in their grazing field. I read a couple chapters of Jeremiah and watched the donkeys roll on their backs in the grass, then they did some playful fighting.
<br>
  Tomorrow I'll land at John Wayne airport (near Long Beach) at 3:30pm where my mom will pick me up and take me to her hometown.
  <br>
  Was my time in Texas successful? 
  <br>
  Yes. One of my goals of experiencing life on a farm (or ranch) was to get an idea as to whether or not this type of work would suit me for a longterm profession. 
  My first answer would be, No, ranching isn't for me. However, since I've only got a first-hand look at one aspect of farming, I don't want to dismiss it entirely. I would like to try some small scale vegetable gardening on my own.
  <br>
  More and more, it seems to me that the temperment of co-workers and work superiors (i.e., those you frequently communicate with at work) can make or break the likelyhood that I would enjoy making any certain job into a career.
  I wish that wasn't the case. I wish I could endure any work environment, with thankfulness, no matter how rude my peers were. But, from the jobs I've had, the degree to which I can nicely cooperate with fellow staff mostly reveals how well I enjoy my work.
  <br>
  Does this mean I should work for myself or create my own company so I can do the hiring? I don't know how much that would help. My point is, I believe farming could be quite enjoyable, if my co-workers and boss respect me. 
  <br>
  Since I know God will continue to mature me, so I trust that over time I will be level-headed enough that I could have a great day at work even on the days my boss drops a bag on blame on my desk.
  <br>
  Until then, I'm thankful I have you.
  <br>
  Thanks for reading.
  <br>
  <c3>See you soon.</c3>

Farm tour 
    <a href=https://youtu.be/g41in_t9yQ0>video.</a> <c4>The wind cancels out my voice during the last three minutes, so I recommend ending the video when I'm looking inside the trailer of butternut squash.</c4> 
<br>
    Tomorrow will be the very last post on this blog. 
    <br>
    I finally got to meet Milo's friend, Cookie, today. I saw a truck pull past the driveway's second gate, so I walked that way and meeting him and his son (about 10 years old) at the tractor he was about to enter. Cookie's voice and personality was much softer than I anticipated, meaning, he was friendlier than I expected. With his son opening gates, Cookie delivered a load of butternut squash to each group of cows. 
    <br> 
    As Cookie's children (his daughters were waiting in his truck at first) went to see the newborn goats, he told me his perspective of how this Munkebo farm is less of a business and more of a animal daycare. Turns out practially all the pigs on this property were originally wild boars, which currently aren't valuable on the market and cost more to raise. I forget the breed of swine that Cookie raises, but they grow so quickly that he sells them for butchering before they reach one year. 
    <br>
    In Cookie's opinion, "these farmers are weirdos. They keep their livestock as pets. That's not what farming is about. I love my hogs too, but I know what their ultimate purpose is for, so my kids give them names like 'Porkchop' cuz they also know that we can't keep a bunch of pets for fun."
    <br>
    Being a former vegan, I can easily understand the mentailty of both ranching styles. I imagine those decisions could be quite tricky when you consider both ethics and emotions. One thing I've learned on this farm is: food should be more expensive. You may be thinking, "Umm, isn't $2 for one organic apple a bit much? Or $8 for just a few onuces of pasture raised beef?" For some poor people it could definitely be totally out of their budget, yes. Hmm, I'm not sure how much time I want to spend talking about this subject, especially since I'm not very good at expressing my ideas through essay form like this. If you'd like, remind me about this conversation one of these times I see you this year. 
    
  
   <br>
   <br>
    <br>
<c2>Day 14 : Jan 22</c2>
    <br>
  Two more full days to go on this farm, then I'll be back in my hometown. I could call Tucson my hometown since I was born and raised there, but because I've lived most of my life in Yucaipa, I call that my hometown.
  <br>
  Anyways, another day spent indoors, which is a good way to make a blog boring. I don't want this blog to end anticlimatically, so  tomorrow I'll record some video on the farm, as a way to conclude my adventures in this tiny part of Texas.
  <br>
  For those of you reading this, I'm really looking forward to spending time with you in person.
  
  
    
    <br>
   <br>
    <br>
<c1>Day 13 : Jan 21</c1>
    <br>
  Not much to report today. All the farmers went on their four day trip (they return Thursday night), while I fed the animals their breakfast and dinner.
  <br>
  Besides taking a long walk to the end of this property for the first time (discovering a creek-bed of flint rocks), I stayed inside browsing the web. 
<br>
  Until next time, <br>cheers

<c2>Day 12 : Jan 20</c2>
    <br>
Sunny Sunday, seen 
    <a href=https://photos.app.goo.gl/5DxxmuxoNhfsGeFE7>here.</a> 
<br>
    Last night I was about to edit yesterday's blog post, about not being exciting for a short trip to Austin, when I found some interesting places on Google maps. One being a performing arts center and another a children's play house. From the photos I saw online I thought those places might be fun to tour, so this morning I was in a good mood helping Ivan load his truck with frozen meat, then setting up his canopy at the farmer's market. At 8:31am I went exploring the east side of Austin (I didn't wander more than a couple miles from where Ivan was selling).
    <br>
    After walking through a small park, I strolled past a quiet, but large, hostipal. I was tempted to get a hot tea from Starbucks since my hands were cold (even with gloves), but I didn't want to pay a high price for low-grade herbs, especially when I knew the farmer's market I would soon return to would have quality drinks.
    <br>
    I found the performing arts center, just outside were church welcome banners and worship music playing from an unknown location. Inside the arts center window I couldn't see anything intriguing, so I continued down the street to a grocery store, called HEB. 
    <br>
    Last week in Austin, I bought a pack of veggie rice rolls. I thought a teaspoon of wasabi wouldn't faze me, but, I was wrong. That's an experience worth doing once a year. Anyways, this time at HEB, I found my favorite aisle: nutrition bars. They had such a wide variety that it was hard to decide what my 2nd breakfast would be. Finally, I had my three bars: two of Bobo's, and one GoMacro (which I'd been wanting to try, but I'll never buy another one. No flavor).
    <br>
    Thinkery is the name of the indoor kids play place, and I was just in time for its 10am opening, with dozens of parents and toddlers waiting in the plaza to enter. I took a glance into Thinkery's lobby, which had an idendical look to a cinema's. The admission line and row of cashiers intimidated me, so I made my way around the little pond seperating this kid's place and the farmer's market.
    <br>
    The French bakery vendor on one side of Ivan's stand was busy (who I would later buy quiche from), but the lady selling granola on the other side wasn't, so I made conversation. She was surprised that Austin didn't impress me enough to stay, since all her friends fell in love quickly. 
    <br>
    This small outdoor market had about fifty vendors total, most selling vegetables or meat. When I saw them all, twice, I decicded to explore the neighborhood in opposite direction I traveled earlier. Ten minutes later, all the energy bar sugar and lack of water made me realize I needed a little nap. So I headed back to a tennis court I passed.
    <br>
    All four courts were empty, so I picked the best nap bench and lay down. A young lady arrived, dropped her gym bag, did a quick warm-up, then practiced her tennis serves. Since it appeared she was planning to practice alone, I offered to pick up the stary balls in order to save her time. She accepted my offer, and after a little time having explained why I was in Austin, she asked if I wanted to use her other raquet. I expected her skills to be amazing, but she was only a bit better than me, so I had an enhjoyable time vollying back and forth.
    <br>
    On my way back to Ivan's meat stand, I thought to myself, "That doesn't seem very fair to her. Since I had plenty of time to talk to her, and this is probably the very last time I'll ever see her, I should give her some piece of info that might help her find salvation." So I turned around and returned to the court I was just playing at. "Hello again," I said, "I wanted to give you the one piece of advice which is extremely important. Have you read the Bible?"
<br>
    "No."
    <br>
    "Okay, well, you've heard of that book, right?"
    <br>
    "Yeah."
    <br>
    "Of all the things I could ever encourage you to do, the most important thing I know is to read the Bible. Because, that's where you'll learn about Jesus."
    <br>
    "Oh. Do you read the Bible?"
   <br>
    "Yeah, I read it. Because, well, it's the only book that has God's words, the book with truth about life, after-life. So, please try reading the parts that talk about Jesus."
    <br>
    "Alright, thanks."
    <br>
    "Bye."
    <br>
    When Ivan and I returned to this farm, I read some of that boring Texas mordern history book, then went on an eight eight mile bike ride just before sunset.
   
    
    
    
    
        
    <br>
   <br>
    <br>
<c1>Day 11 : Jan 19</c1>
    <br>
Two baby goats and one baby cow, born this week,
    <a href=https://photos.app.goo.gl/tVSEvjEQzGYtgd7p7>photos.</a> (The goats belong to the neighbor.)
<br>
    A little before sunset I followed Ivan to check on the calf. Ivan hadn't yet seen this baby drink milk from his mother, so we watched as the calf got up from a nap and wobbling to it's mother. But just before that, I approached the mother putting out my hand for her to sniff me (as I do with all animals when meeting them the first time). I expected her to immediately walk away in fear, but since she didn't, I pet her nose, and since she still looked comfortable, I gave her some back and neck rubs. I was surprsied how warm and soft she was. Which felt very nice in the 30+mph winter wind. I asked Ivan if I can try to get some milk out of her (thinking that, if necessary we could fill a bottle for the calf), with his approval I got one squirt, but she must've been a little bothered since she walked away. Then, a couple minutes later, when this calf stepped out from under the tree to clumsily try for some milk, the mother pushed her child away as soon as he was about to drink. Ivan thought this odd, but he was patient to see what they would do next since they moved away from both Ivan and myself aswell as the small herd that was feeding on a bale of hay during this time. Minutes later, success! The mother let her baby feed.
    <br>
    I spent a few hours today riding on the side of Milo's tractor, opening gates as he delivered hay bales to cows, bulls, heifers, and horses.
    <br>
    I'm not looking forward to going to Austin tomorrow, since my last experience was quite boring, and I don't know what I should do this time with only four hours.
    
    
    
    
    
        
    <br>
   <br>
    <br>
<c2>Day 10 : Jan 18</c2>
    <br>
<a href=https://photos.app.goo.gl/GSgypsmcwzNsuCiy9>Photos</a> of some onions I bundled. 
<br>
    In my mind, tomorrow is my last full day of work on this farm. Because this Sunday is my day off (which I'm planning to spend half the day in Austin), Monday thru Thursday I'll be running this farm by myself, but all that's required of me is feeding the animals, and Friday I'll be leaving Texas. 
    <br>
    Since the feeding routine only takes a few hours each day, that leaves me about ten hours of free time each of these upcoming days. I might need to find other activities besides studying Montessori teaching styles, reading some kindle books, and riding a bike.
    <br>
    Anyways, let's talk about today. The highlights were: talking to my sister on the phone (while bundling onions), planting those onions with Milo (even though it only took a few minutes, it was the first gardening I got to do), and dinner with four guests (making a total of nine at the table). A husband and wife (friends of Germaine) and their two young girls ate with us. The ladies carried the discussions, consisting of perenial roses, convenience driven societies, future failing ecosystems, angry radio hosts, and cats that vomit. One of the little girl's, with the nickname "Apple", after saying how much see absolutely loves cat, continued, "When I'm older, I want to be a part-time Youtuber and a part-time vet. Because I just love cats so much." To which I replied, "Yeah, you could do that. Do you think there are any animals that you wouldn't want to fix, like an elephant?" She gave me a what-are-you-talking-about face. I was impressed that someone so young realizes that making Youtube videos is a viable type of work.  
    <br>
    When I told Ivan I'll be heading back to California in a week, he said, "Well, it really worked out that you came when you did. With us taking this trip to visit my aunt 'n all. Yeah, it was like divine intervention, haha."
    <br>
    Am I going to continue this blog when I return to my hometown? Nope. You'll have to contact me directly to find out what I'm doing.

    <br>
<c1>Day 9 : Jan 17</c1>
    <br>
<a href=https://photos.app.goo.gl/xRAKBq5GLG6v5jJA7>Photos</a> of a nice sunny and warm thankful Thursday. You get to see where I sleep (trailer) and where I eat (the house). Why did I take pictures of rocks? Because I thought it interesting how they are common here, but rare in SoCal (at least, I think they are).
<br>
    Today was easy and relaxing (I even took a 15min nap). After lunch I raked up about six huge barrels full of dead oak leaves and dumped them in with the lot of seven pigs (as Ivan told me to). He said the pigs might use the leaves as a kind of blanket for the coming cold, but it appears they only trampeled them into their mud field, after sniffing through them with curiosity for a minute.
    <br>
    I'm surprised the day goes by somewhat quickly, even though I feel I'm hardly doing much work. I'm also thankful that I don't have cravings to check social media, entertainment updates, nor to hear the lastest music from musicians I follow.  Like I said on Day 2, that one of the benefits I know this nature retreat affords me, is allowing me to detox from dumb habits and in-turn reflect on the truly joyful options available. So, even though I may not return to California as the next Jimmy Dean, I do have the chance to turn over some leaves. 
    <br>
    On that note, I'll be flying into John Wayne airport on Jan.25 (Friday). Amazingly, the ticket was only $40, but I paid $70 to add extra baggage. That's another reason this was a thankful Thursday.
    <br>
    In addition, MIR (Montessori in Redlands) said they were happy with my phone interview, and they'd like to have an in-person interview on Jan.30, so, for all ya'll that prayed about that, thanks so much. 
    
    
    
    
    
    
    <br>

    <br>
<c2>Day 8 : Jan 16</c2>
    <br>
No still pictures today, only this short <a href=>video.</a> 
<br>
    The friendly horse's name is Ellie (not seen in the video). She let me pet her plenty today, and she even came toward me after I called her (albiet, several times but I wasn't carrying any food).
    <br>
My morning routine is: get up at 6am, eat breakfast (last few days I microwaved egg burritos, but today I had two sausages and bread), open doors to let out chickens at two different coups, feed ducks by dumping a bucket of grain pellets into some long tin dishes, collect any eggs, work with Milo to mix water and grain powder in ten buckets which we dump in big bowls for all the pigs, then I ride on the side of Milo's tractor opening and closing gates for him as he brings chopped butternut-squash to cows and pigs.
    <br>
We usually finish all that by 11am. Before and after lunch I've been given pretty simple jobs such as collecting firewood, transporting woodchips and piles of leaves to their front garden, or riding with Milo on his frequent trip of fetching a trailer load of vegetables. 
   <br>
    Just before dinner I close the doors to the two chicken sheds (they go inside on their own during twilight). We start eating dinner at about 6pm (e.g., spaghetti, cat fish and mashed potatoes, chili, etc.) followed by washing dishes. As soon as that's done, I know my evening of relaxation has begun, which means sitting in my trailer writing this blog and then reading a book called "God Save Texas" (basically a history of the state, from what I can tell so far) for 15-30 minutes. I would like to read longer, but at 10pm I'm very ready for sleep. Tonight it looks I will have some extra reading time.
    <br> 
    Of course I do important things during the days too: washing my hands, pet a cat, using the toilet, brushing my teeth, talking to God. 
    <br>
    Milo is often talking about his friend, Cookie, who lives in the area. I guess they help each other out with favors, and this time it's Cookie's turn. He'll get the vegetables next week and feed the cows while Ivan, Germaine, and Milo are in Arizona. I'm curious what type of personality this Cookie fellow has. I'm also curious what day I'll return to CA. 
    <br>
    Even if I don't get this job at the Montessori school, I know I want to live near the people who care about me. Which means SoCal has got to be my home. At the same time, I want to be humble and flexible to whatever plans God has for me. I didn't get any signs from Him about coming to Texas, this was mostly my endevor of testing the waters of a southern state and life on a farm. My thought was, "If I love Austin or the farm, then I could try to start a life there. But if not, then I may return to the IE, or try Korea again." In God's kingdom, life is all about attitude and relationships, as you know. Jesus mostly cares about my motivations, my desires, feelings, and how I behave with people. Which means I could serve Him well any place where people are. But, having a team (even in these personal matters) is extremely valuable. I was on an awesome team in the IE, and I miss my team-mates. I need my team. Why should I join a new team?    
    
    
    
    
    
    <br>
<br>
<br>
<c1>Day 7 : Jan 15</c1>
    <br>
Only 12 <a href=>photos</a> today, sorry. It's not because I was so busy, no, I did plently of standing around, listening to Milo tell stories. I suppose my mind was distracted preparing answers for potential questions I might get during my phone interview. More on that later.
<br>
  There are three friendly animals I'd like to introduce to you (as seen in today's album). First, the ram Barnabi (or Barny for short), which Germaine told me means "gentle". My first day meeting him, he was only slightly shy when I tried to pet him. Although, part of the reason is that I was trying to pet his back and he only likes the hair near his horns touched. I can't recall him ever making a single noise, besides his hard hoofs stepping on the wood patio. He slowly walks around the yard, stopping to stare at people as the walk by, or occasionally walk behind me. It was yesterday that proved Barnabi must think of me as a good friend, because the moment I stepped out of Milo's truck (after returning from Austin, and then WalMart) Barny came running up to me. At first I thought he might be excited to see Milo, but for the next several minutes as I made trips from the house to my trailer, he continued to follow me and walk so quickly that I thought he was going to ram my backside. He did once, but it was a very light tap. He's mostly a lone ranger, but lately I've seen him chatting (mind you, without sound) with the lonely pig, which is nice. Well, that's Barny the ram, he's very gentle, but I've also heard he was a bully to a young human. 
    <br>
  Secondly, Rudy the big gold pig loves to beckon people to pet her by making short grunt sounds. Once you start patting her back or rubbing her head, she becomes silent and still. Rudy, and her roommate Leo-Lardo, are the only pigs Milo let's wander around the yard. Because he knows they don't make trouble and they'll return to their pin in a short time. Speaking of Milo's pet pigs. Today we were sad to sell 8 small pigs (not piglets, but young) to another ranch, and I think the profit was only $350. Ivan wanted to sell more, but Milo is emotionally attached to his friends, and even thought all these farmers are trying to sell almost all the animals, it will be hard for Milo. He says to all the pigs as he feeds them, "Come here baby. That's my baby."
    <br>
    Dingo, the mostly blind tail-less dog is very nice. I think the only time I heard him bark is when he was really hungry. He also has diabetes, so he gets an insulin shot in the neck after every meal. I hear he used to have great eyesight and he was very active, but now he seems depressed and he only walks with his head down (probably as a way of preventing running into walls). I haven't spend too much time talking to him, so I don't know his life story. This evening I learned he was rescused by Ivan from neighboring bully dogs. They put up "Dog Found" signs for a month, but no calls. Then a year later, when some friends were at this ranch, a friend told Ivan, "That looks just like my dog." Come to find out, it was his dog, but he didn't want it back anyways.
    <br>
  Lastly, we have Goosta the goose. He actually isn't that friendly with me, making the creepy tongue hissing sound when I get too close. But, of all the ducks and geese though, I guess he's the only one Germaine can pet. And he isn't half as timid as most of the pond birds. Maybe I should have chosen the Arabian horse as this last friendly animal, since he has been letting me pet him. Unlike the other horses, as you can see in the photo with the donkeys, this horse (I need to learn his name) doesn't retreat when I approach him. Milo said he's never sat on him, so don't expect me to see me on him. Anyways, I guess Goosta is kinda cool.
    <br>
  My phone interview with the Montessori school only lasted 25 minutes (including some concluding questions by me), and I think it went smooth enough, especially since I felt mostly calm and thus my voice wasn't shaking with fear. She gave me an overview of their school and the details of this teaching assistant position I'm applying for. Then she asked pretty typical questions: What are your strengths and weaknesses? Why do you want to work at this school? What experience do you have working with children?
    <br>
  To summarize the answers I gave to those: I'm honest with my superiors and having experience with kids I believe I can talk on their level and understand their needs well. A weakness of mine is lack of detailed communication, leaving out information to save time has hurt me in the longrun. I told her that a big reason I'd like to work at their school is because it is close to family, they follow the Montessori philosophies closely, and they have a beautiful campus. To the last question, I quickly mentioned my work in Korea, and as a science tour guide for elementary students at Yucaipa's regional park. Then she told me to expect an email this Friday about whether I make it to the next round of interviews.

<c2>Day 6 : Jan 14</c2>
    <br>
<a href=https://photos.app.goo.gl/7izAvZ5v2ekM5QoJA>Photos</a> of my second long walk through Austin.
    <br>
    I woke up and started watching a speedrun. Feeling completely relaxed and care-free, it became apparent how there are levels of reality: God's kingdom, nature, city life, toys, and fantasy worlds (such as games and movies). I haven't put much thought into this idea, so those category labels are probably not that great. Don't you notice a difference in how you feel about life when you're talking about heaven and miracles, or simply praying with someone, compared to how you feel when you're talking about StarWars? Or, taking a hike seeing the beauty of nature compared to walking around DisneyLand? Well, for me, one feels closer to the way life is supposed to be. Almost like truth is an emotion you can feel, a sense of what is really real. I guess that's the same as knowing what is more or less valuable and important.
     <br>
    And then there are a bunch of other emotions that yell at my mind, or whisper, as I walk in the city of Austin. I walked about a total of eight hours today plus yesterday. The only transportation I took, was a bus this afternoon from downtown Austin into the countryside, where Milo picked me up and then we stopped by WalMart for some groceries. The reason I took a pic of milk and eggs, is so that you can compare the Texas price with what you pay. Just in case you are curious. 
    <br>
    You probably want me to answer these questions: What did you think of Austin? Are you going to live there? What are the people like?
    <br>
    I couldn't quite pin point my nostalgia. Sometimes the plants reminded me of Okinawa, sometimes the neighborhoods felt like Australia, but most of the time I kept thinking of Seattle. I've only been in Seattle a few days (in 2017), but I did a lot of walking there too. I think it was the hipster style of fashion that made that connection. Austin's downtown felt pretty small and most of what I saw everywhere else was gated communities. Apartments everywhere. And the parks, though wide, seemed lacking in trails, playgrounds, or exercise equipment. Of course, having not talked to the locals, and spending less than 36 hours in the city, my judgment isn't going to be that fair. 
    <br>
    No, I don't plan on living there. I'd like to return to the Inland Empire, since that's where my family and friends live. By the way, I have a phone interview with the Montessori in Redlands this week. Let's pray for God's favor in that.

<c1>Day 5 : Jan 13</c1>
    <br>
I walked through the city of Austin, I was surprised how many streets felt ghost-townish.

<c2>Day 4 : Jan 12</c2>
    <br>
 Had my first Texas BBQ. Although, I don't know if it is technically BBQ, since it was cooked indoors in a kitched. But it did have BBQ sauce. It didn't taste any different from sloppy-joe type sandwitches that I've had in CA. The coleslaw though, was much better than any I've had. Less saucey and more, umm, cabbagey.  
    <br>
    As you'll see from today's pictures <a href=https://photos.app.goo.gl/GNgf4cXhFdyZVN9h8>(here)</a> after the round of morning feeding I took a ride. Walking through the maintenance barn, I stopped Milo, "Does this bike work?"
    <br>
    "Yeah, needs a little air, but should be just fine," squeezing the tires "you wanna ride it?"
    <br>
    "Yes, I'd like to."
    <br>
    "Sure, bring it on ova' here and we'll get ya fixed up. Just don't get a flat like all them other WWOOFers do. Heck, I tell them to watch out for crazy drivers and they come back with flats. They must be riding off the road. You break it, you fix it."
    <br>
    I rode east, down the part of the road I'd never seen yet. Huge properties with nice quiet yards, some with beautiful lawns. Absolutely perfect weather for a ride. My first offical exploring in Texas. I wasn't gone more than 30min. Upon returning the bike (with no flat), Milo informed me that every property in this area is 80 acres. 
<br>
    After dropping off our trailer for a refill on organic vegies, we stopped for BBQ, and there were three things I thought odd about the restaurant: 1. the tables were pushed together like a church picnic, 2. the kitchen wall was made by stacking their inventory items on shelves out in the open (so they had a sharpie sign saying, "Don't Take These Items") 3. next to the soda refill station and pickle self-serve fridge, there was a box full of ziplock bagged sliced sandwhich bread. Customers would take it as if it were another condiment.
    <br>
    Milo drove us home on a different route, and after showing me a river, he spotted a friend BBQing next to a small gas station. Turns out this guy was waiting for someone to hire him for a day job. He said he could direct Milo to a nearby house who might have a car part Milo needs. We passed some wide pasture lands and America's 5th largest solar energy field (accoring to Milo). But the retired mechanic didn't have what Milo was hoping for. He did have an extra puppy though, chained to an old rusted truck. The mechanic told this workless friend to take the dog, so he did.
    <br>
    When I finished unloading Germaine's van of farmer's market supplies, she had just started a discussion with Karen about how her farm is more than adaqute to survive a zombie apocalypse. And one of her comforts in such a crisis, is the fact that humans are by nature willing to serve a neighbor in need in such times of distress. I thought of some potential flaws in that theory, but I just said, "That's quite a creative story."
    <br>
    At dinner, Germaine suddenly threw out that I needed to work less. The guys said, "Just don't work more than us" followed by chuckles. But she was serious, "No really, there are some WWOOF rules that we don't want to break, so, just take longer breaks or end the day earlier." Then I asked, "So, do I understand correctly that my main job is feeding all the animals while you're out of town?" The guys laughed harder this time. I'm not sure why it was funny, other than they never mentioned exactly what I'm supposed to do each day while they're visiting a very old relative from Jan 21st to 25th. This sparked a conversation between them about how they would get the cows fed during that time, since it requires driving their small tractor. Maybe I should have told them that I could drive it.
    <br>
   Good news about this Austin trip (starting in 10 hours from now). Ivan will drive me all the way into downtown, since he's going there early tomorrow morning for another farmer's market. I'll sleep at a hostel or AirBnB. Then Monday evening I ride a bus to the tiny town of Manor outside Austin, where Milo picks me up. Besides walking and following the Lord, I don't really have anything planned for the two days.

<c1>Day 3 : Jan 11</c1>
    <br>
    I woke up to an explosion. In my dream. It was an Inception-like dream, not the lucidity part, but the intense action. Some lady was trying to find the secret papers to unlock unkimited power, so my brother and I flew around a fancy hotel to hide these papers in a unexpected location. I was laying under a bed when I knew the lady was following me. Then there are an explosion, and I woke up thinking, "Why was there a blast? That doesn't make any since."
    <br>
    Today was more enjoyable than yesterday. I tried to pray or praise, but so often my mind easily drifts to and fro. Most of the day I spent cleaning braches off bamboo shafts (seen <a href=>here</a>). 
     <br>
    I like opening the heavy metal driveway gate to let in Ivan or Milo in their trucks as they bring in different equipment or feed bags. "Where ya been all day?" Milo asks jumping out of his truck, walking to the trailer to unload a couple ton of gravel. "I was cleaning bamboo poles."
     <br>
    "You gunna build yer'self a stick house with that?" He laughs.
     <br>
    As the sun sets behind a dark overcast sky, I continue to stick with Milo, giving a hand by opening and closing more gates as he gets hay for pigs to sleep on. "The pigs need somthin soft ter lay on when this here rain gets going. And ol' JaJa over there is about to have some babies, so she needs a place to get warm with her lil ones."
     <br>
    Before I arrived on this farm, I was afraid the animal dung might really bother me, but thankfully it's not bad. In fact, it's actually kinda... nevermind. I'm also very glad I haven't got hay-fever. When I first met Milo, seeing him as a pontenial rough cowboy, I was very curious to see how he treated the farm animals. Needless to say, he really loves them. Yesterday's note about giving the pigs belly rubs was a reference to exactly what Milo does every time he walks in a muddy pen to feed some.
     <br>
    An hour after lunch, while I continued to cut bamboo, I heard a very frightened pig. I couldn't see it, but I saw some men with a truck in the driveway and realized they must have bought a little buddy. Later this was confirmed when Ivan said, "Did you notice the missing hog from the pen next to the chicken coup?"
     <br>
    "Yeah. His brother got sold huh?"
     <br>
    "Mm-hmm. I was hoping Milo would move the lone guy so he doesn't get too sad by himself. I think he'll prolly do it tomorrow. Now I gotta get some freezer meat ready for tomorrow's farmer's market."
     <br>
    I was hoping I might get to go into town with them tomorrow, but Milo and I will stay here and do the feeding routine. I'm really looking forward to exploring Austin, or even simply seeing more people. Which is what I'm planning to do on my days off: Sunday and Monday. My weekend might go something like: Sunday morning get an 8 mile ride from Germaine to McDonald's, access wifi and get an Uber ride 20 miles into Austin. Explore on foot, bus, or an Uber scooter. Sleep at an AirBnB for about $20. Explore more on Monday and ride a bus out of the city, and get a ride from one of my bosses back to Munkebo Farm.

<c2>Day 2 : Jan 10</c2>
    <br>
Only 24 hours on this ranch and already I'm contemplating, "Why am I doing this? Who would want to do this kind of work everyday? All I'm doing is feeding pigs and shoveling wood-chips into a wheel-barrel. On the other hand, even if the animals don't appreciate my work, surely the person (that one guy sitting alone watching TV in Reno) who eats this bacon next month will be thankful. And if I don't do this ministry of personally delivering organic butternut squash to each pig's trough and giving them rib massages, then the only meat available at WholeFoods would be from tortured slaughter factories."
    <br>
    My spoiled SoCal luxary life must be starting to detox already. I don't wanna wake at 6, I don't wanna skip my 2nd breakfast, I don't wanna skip my afternoon nap, I don't wanna spend the evening in a boring frosty cabin. Well, I found a solution to the last one: type this blog under my thick bed blankets while listening to music.
    <br>
        Milo continues to dream of the day when this ranch is converted into a small vegetable garden so that he can kick back with a beer and watch the weeds grow, and then the only work he has to do, is pull them. Which is totally understandable for a man who's done demanding physical labor for 60 years. But this mentality among these aging ranchers certainly doesn't inspire me to pursue this career. My mind wanders to other lucrative careers that don't require a sore back, as I collect wood for cutting.
<br>
    At the same time, I don't want to be primarily motivated by money. Though, it's been hard not to when starting a family is a big dream. I am thankful for the mini revelation God gave me as my plane made its decent into Austin. Seeing such micro cars slowly snake around curves and white crumb-sized buildings poke out between forests, I realized: why does money matter? I'm about to become one of those super tiny (and very slow) land creatures as soon as this plane touches the ground, and no one in China will be thinking about me. No one in Texas will be thinking about me, besides the other extremely small humans who might glance at me as they crawl a short distance, probably just to nibble on some cheese. No one in Europe. No one in Africa. Two people in America, maybe... in other words, the world is huge and my life is tiny. My glory is smaller, and my needs to live are just as little as I am. So why do I need thousands and thousands of American dollars? For a stove and a bag of wheat flour? For a private spa and Deluxe Hummer? God, being inventor and creator of my whole life (and everything), is the only treasure worth my time. No matter how small or big I feel, no matter how much or little I own.
<br> 
    Take Karen for example, she survived well enough in a primitive log cabin for two years in the cold mountains, with two babies. She told me that today. Now she has five children, but was her life less valuable as a poor mountain woman? 
<br>
    I'm not giving up on my farm dreams yet. Like I said, I still need to detox from city life and embrace the quiet country for what is it.

<c1>Day 1 : Jan 9</c1>
      <br>
"Oh, let's see, we've surely had more than 100 volunteers at our farm over the past eight years," Germaine tells me in her southern accent, as she drives me out of Austin past wide pastures to her ranch. Upon arriving she gives me a quick tour of the few buildings clustered on the south side of the property.
      <br>"My father was an art collector," leading into a long story of her recent family trials and triumphs. "Are those from your father too?" pointing at African artifacts in her living room. "No, my mother was an artist as well."
      <br>
      "Let's see if Milo is on the tractor, maybe he can show you the farm." Walking past piles of scrap metal, I've spotted more deserted vehicles than cows. "Milo and Ivan love cars, but we're trying to downsize so we can travel."
      <br>
      "Milo, this is Dean," as we shake hands,"this is his first time WWOOFing, so go easy on him."
      <br>
      "Sure, he'll be fine. He can ride in the truck when I take the trailer." I opened the two long gates on the driveway leading to the road. I was back on the same road, this time in a large manual diesel Dodge truck, towing a huge trailer which will be filled with organic vegetables from a local factory, to used as pig feed.
      <br>Milo's right ear is deaf, so I loudy ask, "Don't you get tired of training so many volunteers?"
      <br>
     His drawl and scratchy voice make me focus my ears,"Nah, I don't mind. It's fun. If I can teach one important thing to these youngsters, than it's worth it. You never know what will be useful later." He smiles, putting the truck in reverse, backing into the factory parking bay, "My father was a great teacher."
      <br>On the way home, after getting two massive bales of hay (for cow feed), I ask, "how many cows are on the farm?"
      <br>"Hmm, well we had about 30, but we're at 24 now, 22? And three horses, two donkeys, 50 ducks, and 30 some pigs. If we have time today, I'll show you my friend Leo, he's a gigantic guy, easily 300 pounds."
      <br> After putting some blankets inside the trailer which I'll sleep in, I walk across the muddy yard in my new boots into the house for dinner. Germaine is still fixing the salad, so I talk to her friend Karan at the table about her daughter in South Korea. She asks if I can recommend a store where she might be able to find American foods. After thinking a minute, I remember Costco is in Seoul. 
      <br> When the non-spicy meat curry is served, Ivan (Germaine's husband) says, "you can say a blessing, if you normally do that." 
      <br>"I'll do it in my heart."
      <br>"I do that too," he replies.
      <br>Milo and I wash the dishes, and he explains how Corelle plates are hard to break, but when they do shatter, he says it's quite amazing how many tiny pieces of glass you'll find in the oddest places.
     <br>My bedroom is on the other side of a shed, which means I'll need to walk outside around that barrier to upload this blog.
